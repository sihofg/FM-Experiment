EXP NO: 4	GENERATION AND DETECTION OF FM


AIM:
To write a program for Frequency Modulation and Demodulation using SCILAB and to observe and measure the frequency deviation and the modulation index of FM.


EQUIPMENTS REQUIRED

•	Computer with i3 Processor
•	SCI LAB

THEORY:

Frequency modulation is a type of modulation in which the frequency of the high frequency (carrier) is varied in accordance with the instantaneous value of the modulating signal.
FREQUENCY DEVIATION f and MODULATION INDEX m f :
The frequency deviation f represents the maximum shift between the  modulatedsignal
frequency, over and under the frequency of the carrier.

We define modulation index m f the ratio between f and the modulating frequency
m= f / fm


FREQUENCY MODULATION GENERATION:
The circuits used to generate a frequency modulation must vary the frequency of a high frequency signal (carrier) as function of the amplitude of a low frequency signal (modulating signal). In practice there are two main methods used to generate FM.
Algorithm
1.	Define Parameters:
•	Fs: Sampling frequency.
•	T: Duration of the signal.
•	Fc: Carrier frequency.
•	Fm: Frequency of the modulating signal.
•	Beta: Modulation index, which controls the extent of frequency deviation.
2.	Generate Signals:
•	Modulating signal: Sinusoidal signal used for modulation.
•	Carrier signal: The high-frequency carrier signal.
•	Modulated signal: FM modulated signal calculated by varying the carrier frequency according to the modulating signal.
3.	FM Modulation:
•	Modulated signal is obtained by modulating the carrier signal with the modulating signal.
 
4.	FM Demodulation:
•	Differentiation: Computes the derivative of the modulated signal to extract frequency variations.
•	Envelope Detection: Takes the absolute value to retrieve the envelope of the signal.
•	Low-pass Filtering: Applies a Butterworth low-pass filter to smooth the envelope and recover the original modulating signal.
5.	Visualization:
•	Plots the modulating signal, carrier signal, FM modulated signal, and demodulated signal for analysis.

Calculation
Frequency Deviation Practical = 2469

Modulation Index Practical	= 0.031

Modulation Index Theoretical	=0.490



RESULT:

Thus, the frequency modulation and demodulation is successfully done and the output is experimentally verified.
